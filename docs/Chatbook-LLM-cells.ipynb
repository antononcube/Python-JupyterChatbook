      "text/markdown": "A quadratic equation is an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers and $a \neq 0$. The solutions to a quadratic equation are the values of $x$ that make the equation true.\n\nThere are two main ways to solve a quadratic equation: by factoring and by using the quadratic formula.\n\nTo factor a quadratic equation, you need to find two numbers that multiply to $ac$ and add up to $b$. Once you have found these two numbers, you can factor the equation as $(x + p)(x + q) = 0$. Then, you can solve for $x$ by setting each factor equal to zero and solving the resulting equations.\n\nThe quadratic formula is given by $x = \\dfrac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. To use the quadratic formula, you need to know the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. Once you have these values, you can plug them into the quadratic formula and solve for $x$.\n\nHere is an example of how to solve a quadratic equation by factoring:\n\nSolve the equation $x^2 + 3x - 10 = 0$.\n\nTo factor this equation, we need to find two numbers that multiply to $-10$ and add up to $3$. The two numbers $-5$ and $2$ satisfy these conditions, so we can factor the equation as $(x - 5)(x + 2) = 0$.\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$ by setting each factor equal to zero and solving the resulting equations:\n\n$x - 5 = 0$ or $x + 2 = 0$\n\n$x = 5$ or $x = -2$\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation $x^2 + 3x - 10 = 0$ are $x = 5$ and $x = -2$.\n\nHere is an example of how to solve a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nSolve the equation $x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0$.\n\nTo use the quadratic formula, we need to know the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. In this case, $a = 1$, $b = -2$, and $c = -8$.\n\nPlugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\dfrac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-8)}}{2 \\cdot 1}$\n\n$x = \\dfrac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{40}}{2}$\n\n$x = \\dfrac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{10}}{2}$\n\n$x = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{10}$\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation $x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0$ are $x = 1 + \\sqrt{10}$ and $x = 1 - \\sqrt{10}$.\n\nHere is a Python code for solving a quadratic equation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_quadratic_equation(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"Solve the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The coefficient of the $x^2$ term.\n        b (int): The coefficient of the $x$ term.\n        c (int): The constant term.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of the solutions to the equation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if a == 0:\n        if b == 0:\n            if c == 0:\n                return [0]\n            else:\n                return []\n        else:\n            return [-c / b]\n\n    d = b**2 - 4*a*c\n    if d < 0:\n        return []\n    elif d == 0:\n        return [-b / (2*a)]\n    else:\n        return [(-b + sqrt(d)) / (2*a), (-b - sqrt(d)) / (2*a)]\n```"
