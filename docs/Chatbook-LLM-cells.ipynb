The majority of the population is of mixed race, with a significant minority of white people and black people. There are also small populations of indigenous people and people of Asian descent.\n",

      "The population of Brazil is growing at a rate of 0.7% per year. This is a relatively slow rate of growth, compared to other countries in Latin America. The main reason for the slow growth rate is the decline in the fertility rate. The average woman in Brazil now has 1.7 children, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman.\n",

This is due to the decline in the fertility rate and the increase in life expectancy. The aging population is putting a strain on the country's social security system and healthcare system.\n",
